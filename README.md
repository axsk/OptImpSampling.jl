# OptImpSampling.jl

A WIP collection of algorithms related to optimal importance sampling (OIS)

- ociso: OIS for Koopman eigen- and chi functions
- isokann: ISOKANN using OIS for the chi approximations
- sqra: Square root approximation for the generators of Ito diffusions
- logvar: OIS  of path functionals with control variates
- reinforce: OIS of functions via REINFORCE
- fbsde: Forward backward SDE with Neural Controls, learning all times at once
